1. Build Project:

2. Add the JAR File to PyFlink Environment:
   1. Place the built JAR file in the directory of the PyFlink project.
   2. Add the JAR file to the PyFlink environment using the `add_jars` method of the `StreamExecutionEnvironment` class. 
   
      ```
      from pyflink.common import Configuration
      from pyflink.datastream import StreamExecutionEnvironment
      from pyflink.table import StreamTableEnvironment

      env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment()
      env.add_jars("path/to/your/jar_file.jar")
      t_env = StreamTableEnvironment.create(env)
      ```
3. Use the Java UDF in PyFlink:

    By retrieving an instance of the Java class, you can utilize its methods and integrate it into your PyFlink job.
    ```
    from pyflink.java_gateway import get_gateway

    gateway = get_gateway()
    java_udf_instance = gateway.jvm.org.serialization.Tuple2SerializationSchema()
    ```
